# C Preprocessor
Preprocessor is not a compiler. It's rather a stage in the compilation of
a C program. The compilation of a C program is divided into these steps

- Preprocessor
- Compiler
- Assembler
- Linker

A preprocessor cleans up the code for the compiler. It does the following

- removes comments
- analyze macros directives

## Macros
We have been using macros when we used the `#include` directive. Let's take a 
closer look.
